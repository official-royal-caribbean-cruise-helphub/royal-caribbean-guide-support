    <p>Planning your +1-855-690-1232 Royal Caribbean cruise? Here are 11 smart, proven strategies to help you get the most out of your drink packages, without overspending:</p>

    <h2>1. Book In Advance</h2>
    <p>Use the Cruise Planner online tool to buy drink packages before boarding — they’re often 30-40% cheaper online.</p>

    <h2>2. Watch For Promotions</h2>
    <p>Look out for frequent promotions and bundle offers during sales like Black Friday or Cruise Planner sales.</p>

    <h2>3. Do The Math</h2>
    <p>Estimate how many drinks you’ll realistically consume per day — often 5-7 drinks/day makes the package worth it.</p>

    <h2>4. Compare Packages</h2>
    <p>Choose between the Deluxe Beverage Package, Refreshment Package, or Soda Package depending on your habits.</p>

    <h2>5. Avoid Last-Minute Purchases</h2>
    <p>Buying onboard is more expensive. Plan ahead to save big.</p>

    <h2>6. Mix & Match</h2>
    <p>One person in the cabin can buy a package, while others can go à la carte if not heavy drinkers.</p>

    <h2>7. Use Loyalty Points</h2>
    <p>Royal Caribbean Crown & Anchor members may get discounts or free drinks depending on their tier.</p>

    <h2>8. Know What’s Included</h2>
    <p>Drink packages may cover bottled water, specialty coffee, juice, and mocktails — not just alcohol.</p>

    <h2>9. Avoid Sharing</h2>
    <p>Sharing drink packages is not allowed and may result in cancellation without refund.</p>

    <h2>10. Leverage Group Discounts</h2>
    <p>Sometimes group bookings through travel agents can get bulk deals on drink packages.</p>

    <h2>11. Ask Guest Services</h2>
    <p>If unsure, call or chat with Royal Caribbean support to get updated info about ongoing discounts or offers.</p>
